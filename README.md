# ðŸš€ Redis Cache PoC

Welcome to the **Redis Cache Proof of Concept (PoC)** project, developed during my internship at **Rxefy**. This project demonstrates how integrating a Redis cache with a Node.js and Express application can significantly reduce API response times.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to showcase the performance improvement achieved by caching API responses using Redis. By caching frequent API requests, we can reduce the load on the server and improve the overall response time.

## Features

- **Fast API responses**: Leveraging Redis to cache data and reduce response time.
- **Easy integration**: Simple Node.js and Express setup.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for scaling with large datasets and high request rates.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** ![Node.js](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/nodejs.png)
- **Express.js** ![Express.js](https://img.icons8.com/color/48/000000/express.png)
